# Todo List: 8-Hour React Order Management System GUI

This list focuses on building a minimal, realistic order management system front-end, limited to 8 hours of work. The UI should resemble a real app, with basic pages and flows for managing orders (and optionally customers/products if supported by the API).

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Create a new directory for the React front-end (e.g., `frontend`).
- [x] Initialize a new React project (e.g., with Create React App or Vite) with TypeScript.
- [x] Add a basic README for the front-end and update the main project README with run instructions.

## 2. API Exploration & Integration
- [x] Review/document available API endpoints (from backend code or Swagger/OpenAPI if available).
- [x] Set up environment variable for API base URL.
- [x] Implement a simple API client (Axios or Fetch) with error handling.

## 3. UI/UX Design
- [x] Design a minimal real-app layout (sidebar/topbar, main content area).
- [x] Add navigation for main sections: Orders, (optionally Customers/Products).
- [x] Use modern UI components (tables, forms, dialogs).

## 4. Core Features for Order Management
- [x] Orders List Page: View all orders in a table with basic info.
- [x] Order Details Page: View details of a selected order.
- [x] Create/Edit Order Page: Form to create or update an order.
- [x] Products Page: List and basic details if supported by API.

## 5. Developer Experience & Documentation
- [x] Add ESLint and Prettier for code quality.
- [x] Add instructions in README for running the GUI and connecting it to the API.

This list is scoped for an 8-hour MVP. Advanced features are excluded. Items will be checked off as completed.
